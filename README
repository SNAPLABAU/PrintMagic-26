# PrintQueue — Electron Print Queue Manager

A professional print queue manager with folder watching, printer pool management, and support for specialty printers like the SwftPro K30.

## Features

- **Folder Watching**: Automatically detects files dropped into the `in` folder
- **Printer Pool**: Add/remove printers, drag to reorder priority
- **Three-Folder Workflow**: `in` → `pending` → `printed`
- **Native Printing**: Uses `node-printer` for direct, driver-level printing
- **Raw/Label Printer Support**: ZPL, EPL, RAW data types for printers like SwftPro K30
- **Print History**: Track all jobs with retry for failed jobs
- **Per-Printer Settings**: Toggle enabled/disabled, raw mode, data type

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

> **Note on `node-printer`**: This package requires native compilation. On Windows you may need the Visual C++ Build Tools. On macOS/Linux, Xcode CLI tools or `build-essential` are needed.
>
> If `node-printer` fails to compile, the app falls back to OS-level `lp` / `rundll32` printing automatically.

### Run

```bash
npm start
```

## SwftPro K30 Setup

1. Install the SwftPro K30 driver and ensure it appears in your system printers.
2. In the **Printers** tab, either click the printer from the System Printers list (it will auto-detect) OR add it manually:
   - **Printer Name**: Exact name as it appears in your OS
   - **Type**: Label Printer (ZPL/EPL) or Raw/Custom
   - **Raw Mode**: Toggle ON for direct data passthrough (bypasses driver processing)
   - **Data Type**: Select RAW or ZPL depending on your file format
